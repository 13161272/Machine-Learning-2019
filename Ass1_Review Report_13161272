Review Report on “Generative Adversarial Nets”
Introduction:

Generative Adversarial Networks is a class in machine learning systems which generates new data with similar statistics as of training data. It involves 2 sets of data models, the generative model which synthesis the trained data and the discriminative network that evaluates the generative model. It is basically the game contest of two neural networks. The generative training data aims at increasing the error rate of the discriminative network by fooling it to synthesize the data that are the part of true data distribution. Typically the generative model is seeded with the random data that is sampled from the functional space. The discriminator evaluates the candidates synthesized by the generative model. Backpropagation is applied in both the networks such that the generator improves the syntheses and the discriminator becomes more skilled in committing the mistake(Wikipedia Jul 2019).
